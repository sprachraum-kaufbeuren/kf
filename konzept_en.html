  <h2>II. Mission Statement</h2>

  <h3>1. Visions and Values</h3>

  <h4>1.1 Nutrition</h4>
  <p>
    Vision: “Our vision is a world in which conscious, sustainable,
    and enjoyable nutrition forms the foundation for health,
    quality of life, and responsibility toward people and nature.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Mission statement: At our institution “SprachRaum Kaufbeuren,”
    nutrition represents more than just food intake – it is an
    expression of culture, community, and mindfulness. We believe
    that knowledge about healthy and sustainable nutrition empowers
    people to act independently and responsibly. We aim to create
    learning environments where enjoyment, education, and awareness
    of personal health and the environment grow together.
  </p>

  <h4>1.2 Freedom of Religion</h4>
  <p>
    Vision: “A world in which every person can freely choose,
    practice, or reject their religion – with mutual respect,
    peace, and without fear of discrimination.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Mission statement: At our institution “SprachRaum Kaufbeuren,”
    freedom of religion is central to respectful coexistence.
    We believe that open dialogue about language, culture, and faith
    fosters understanding and tolerance. This enables individual and
    social development in which diversity is experienced and lived
    as a strength.
  </p>

  <h4>1.3 Participation</h4>
  <p>
    Vision: “All visitors to our institution are entitled to
    actively shape their language learning process and adapt it
    to their individual pace.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Mission statement: At our institution “SprachRaum Kaufbeuren,”
    participation is a core principle. Everyone has the opportunity
    to help shape the institution and use it according to their
    individual needs. This forms the basis for positive development
    and enjoyment in learning languages.
